    <p>For the record, nothing much really happened. I just sat in a car with my brother while we were sleep deprived, and we loudly sang various songs. Some nice taquitos I ate though.</p>

    <p>They say everything looks better with odd numbers of things. But sometimes I put even numbers—just to upset the critics. There is immense joy in just watching - watching all the little creatures in nature. This present moment is perfect simply due to the fact you're experiencing it. We'll paint one happy little tree right here.</p>

<p>Everybody needs a friend. You create the dream - then you bring it into your world. Just let your mind wander and enjoy. This should make you happy. This is the fun part</p>

<p>We spend so much of our life looking - but never seeing. Of course he's a happy little stone, cause we don't have any other kind. We don't make mistakes we just have happy little accidents. I'm a water fanatic. I love water.</p>

<p>Now then, let's play. Once you learn the technique, ohhh! Turn you loose on the world; you become a tiger. Even trees need a friend. We all need friends. Go out on a limb - that's where the fruit is. Only eight colors that you need.</p>

<p>You don't want to kill all your dark areas they are very important. It's a very cold picture, I may have to go get my coat. It’s about to freeze me to death. Don't fiddle with it all day. We tell people sometimes: we're like drug dealers, come into town and get everybody absolutely addicted to painting. It doesn't take much to get you addicted.</p>
