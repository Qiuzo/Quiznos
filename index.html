			<p>	Here we're limited by the time we have. We need dark in order to show light. Very easy to work these to death. Everyone needs a friend. Friends are the most valuable things in the world. There's not a thing in the world wrong with washing your brush. This present moment is perfect simply due to the fact you're experiencing it. Anytime you learn something your time and energy are not wasted. Nothing's gonna make your husband or wife madder than coming home and having a snow-covered dinner. What the devil.</p>

<p>	The man who does the best job is the one who is happy at his job. Let's do that again. Life is too short to be alone, too precious. Share it with a friend. Maybe there's a happy little bush that lives right there. Nothing wrong with washing your brush. We have no limits to our world. We're only limited by our imagination. The light is your friend. Preserve it. Be so very light. Be a gentle whisper. You are only limited by your imagination.</p>

<p>	I'm sort of a softy, I couldn't shoot Bambi except with a camera. That's a crooked tree. We'll send him to Washington. Everybody needs a friend. There's nothing wrong with having a tree as a friend. Water's like me. It's laaazy ... Boy, it always looks for the easiest way to do things These trees are so much fun. I get started on them and I have a hard time stopping. That's what makes life fun. That you can make these decisions. That you can create the world that you want. Every single thing in the world has its own personality - and it is up to you to make friends with the little rascals.</p>

    <h1>Hello, Gakko!</h1>

    <img alt="a clever meme where two girls are fighting, labelled republicans and democrats. A boy in the background with an odd pose is labelled as the 1%." src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/210815251355140096/462761028892229632/image.jpg">
    <p>For the record, nothing much really happened. I just sat in a car with my brother while we were sleep deprived, and we loudly sang various songs. Some nice taquitos I ate though.</p>

    <p>They say everything looks better with odd numbers of things. But sometimes I put even numbers—just to upset the critics. There is immense joy in just watching - watching all the little creatures in nature. This present moment is perfect simply due to the fact you're experiencing it. We'll paint one happy little tree right here.</p>

	<p>Everybody needs a friend. You create the dream - then you bring it into your world. Just let your mind wander and enjoy. This should make you happy. This is the fun part</p>

	<p>We spend so much of our life looking - but never seeing. Of course he's a happy little stone, cause we don't have any other kind. We don't make mistakes we just have happy little accidents. I'm a water fanatic. I love water.</p>

	<p>Now then, let's play. Once you learn the technique, ohhh! Turn you loose on the world; you become a tiger. Even trees need a friend. We all need friends. Go out on a limb - that's where the fruit is. Only eight colors that you need.</p>

	<p>You don't want to kill all your dark areas they are very important. It's a very cold picture, I may have to go get my coat. It’s about to freeze me to death. Don't fiddle with it all day. We tell people sometimes: we're like drug dealers, come into town and get everybody absolutely addicted to painting. It doesn't take much to get you addicted.</p>
